# Commit Message Guidelines for git-upload

This file is automatically referenced when generating AI commit messages via `git upload -ai`.

## Project Context

This repository contains **helpers**: a collection of shell scripts that extend Git with user-friendly commands:

- `git-upload` - Stage, commit, and push in one command (with optional AI commit messages)
- `git-get` - Clone or pull with smart defaults
- `git-initialize` - Initialize repos with sensible defaults
- `git-remerge` - Re-apply failed merges safely
- `git-resolve` - Interactive conflict resolution helper
- `git-fucked-the-push` - Recovery tool for push failures

## Commit Message Style

### Subject Line

- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be specific: name the script/function affected
- Max 72 characters
- No period at end

### Body Structure

Write naturally — describe the situation, what you did, and why. Someone
reading git blame should understand the reasoning without opening the diff.

DO NOT use rigid section headers like "Summary:", "Why:", "What changed:".
Those scream "AI wrote this". Just write a short paragraph or bullets.

For a tiny fix: one sentence or no body at all.
For a small change: a short paragraph.
For a medium change: a sentence of context, then bullets.

Always include these at the end, after a blank line:

```
Breaking changes: none | specific list of what breaks
Risk: low|medium|high (rationale)
Testing: <status from test suite>
```

### Examples of Good Subjects

- `Add early-exit when nothing to commit in git-upload`
- `Fix spinner not stopping on SIGINT in git-upload`
- `Reduce AI timeout from 300s to 60s for faster failures`

### Examples of Bad Subjects

- `Update script` (which script?)
- `Fix bug` (what bug?)
- `Improve performance` (how? where?)

## File Conventions

| Path                 | Purpose                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `git-*`              | Main shell scripts (user commands) |
| `scripts/`           | Build and test utilities           |
| `man/man1/`          | Man pages for each command         |
| `build/`             | Build artifacts (not committed)    |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD pipelines                    |

## IF VERSION WAS BUMPED

Compare diffs from the old version, then write new release notes for the new version. These release notes should be concise bullet points outlining new features and quick 5-10 word explinations, really as simple as it can get. Ensure that the markdown file matching the version number (`v!.@.#.md` replace !.@.# with actual version number for release) is created in the release-notes folder BEFORE COMMIT AND FINAL UPLOAD. If upload has started and there is a new version, go back and repair this issue by running this flow, commit a second time (if necessary, e.g. you already commited then realized new version doesn't have release notes, commit ontop of your other commit, no need to revise or change history) then push.
