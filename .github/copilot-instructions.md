description: "Git Shell Helpers workspace baseline: architecture, build/test, coding standards, and boundaries."
---

If ever asked to implement something and afterwards it needs to be installed or built, please actually install it or build it afterwards so I can immediatley see the live results from this change, it does no good to me to sit in just this workspace. Always ensure installers and scripts for others to install GSH onto their machines, plus the packages and everything always stay up to date.

# Workspace Baseline

Git Shell Helpers (`github-shell-helpers`) — shell-based git helpers, MCP servers, Copilot customization automation, a VS Code extension, and a community-backed research cache.

## Non-Negotiable Boundary

- `copilot-config/` is product source shipped to users.
- `.github/` is repository development config and supporting project assets.

When updating shipped Copilot customization behavior, edit `copilot-config/`. When updating repository workflows, docs, and governance assets, edit `.github/`.

## Build and Test

- **Test**: `bash ./scripts/test.sh` (from repo root)
- **State recovery test**: `bash ./scripts/test-git-upload-states.sh`
- **Build installer**: `./scripts/build-dist.sh`
- **Build macOS pkg**: `./scripts/build-pkg.sh`
- **Build VSIX**: `./scripts/build-vsix.sh`
- **Version**: stored in `VERSION` (single-line semver)

Always run tests after modifying shell commands or the VS Code extension.

## Architecture Map

### Monolithic files — handle with care

These files are large and tightly coupled. **Check actual size with `wc -l` before planning edits** — line counts change as modules are extracted. Do not make small patches without understanding surrounding context.

| File                            | Domain                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vscode-extension/extension.js` | VS Code extension (MCP client, commands, config)                       |
| `git-research-mcp`              | Node.js MCP server (web search, knowledge index, headless Chrome)      |
| `native/src/gitcli/`            | Rust: the git-* CLIs (upload, checkpoint, resolve, scan, scrub, …)     |
| `native/src/tools/setup.rs`     | Rust: `gsh setup` / project_setup — deterministic project build-out    |
| `git-copilot-quickstart`        | Bash: scaffold Copilot workflows                                       |

**Before editing any file over 500 lines**: check `wc -l`, read at least the function index (`grep -n 'function \|^[a-z_]*()' <file>`), and understand the call chain you are modifying. Do not submit an 8-line patch to a large file without understanding the surrounding 200+ lines of context.

### Directory structure

- Shell commands: repo root (`git-upload`, `git-checkpoint`, etc.) — **no `.sh` extension**
- MCP servers: `git-research-mcp` (Node.js), `git-shell-helpers-mcp` (Node.js)
- VS Code extension: `vscode-extension/`
- Vision tools: `vision-tool/`
- Community cache: `community-cache/`
- Build/test scripts: `scripts/`
- Man pages: `man/man1/`
- Knowledge corpus: `knowledge/`
- Copilot product source (shipped to users): `copilot-config/`
- Repo dev config: `.github/`

## Coding Standards

- See `.github/instructions/shell-safety.instructions.md` for shell rules (heredoc prohibition, safe patterns).
- See `.github/instructions/modular-architecture.instructions.md` for file size limits and decomposition principles.
- See `.github/instructions/javascript.instructions.md` for Node.js/extension conventions.
- Keep command `--help` output, man page, and installer behavior aligned in the same change.

## Engineering Defaults

- Prefer MCP tools over shell emulation when tool coverage exists.
- Run strict diagnostics before and after edits.
- Keep command/man page/installer behavior aligned in the same change.
- Treat remote repository state as canonical for community-driven data; local cache copies are accelerators, not source of truth.

## Detailed Sources of Truth

- Copilot system assets: `copilot-config/agents/`, `copilot-config/skills/`, `copilot-config/instructions/`, `copilot-config/prompts/`
- Build/test/release workflows: `.github/workflows/`
- Knowledge corpus and philosophy: `knowledge/`, `knowledge/knowledge-philosophy.md`
- Community cache automation scripts: `scripts/community-cache-*.sh`, `scripts/community-research-submit.sh`
- Local sub-agent MCP surface: `lib/mcp-local-subagents.js` (`ollama_subagent`, `ollama_list_models`, `system_execute`, `build_workspace_tool`)
- Vision tool split: `vision-tool/mcp-server.js` handles `take_screenshot` locally; `analyze_images` / `analyze_video` still depend on the vision extension IPC backend.
- Repo-only local reference cache: `.github/devops-audit-community-cache/`
