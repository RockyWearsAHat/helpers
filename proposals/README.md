# VS Code Upstream Proposals

This directory contains PR-ready proposals for VS Code features that helpers currently implements via bundle patches and proposed APIs. Each proposal is self-contained with motivation, implementation specification, and backward-compatibility design.

## Proposals

## Obsolescence Strategy

See [OBSOLESCENCE-STRATEGY.md](OBSOLESCENCE-STRATEGY.md) for how our patch system gracefully degrades as upstream features land.

## How We Use These Today

Our extension (`RockyWearsAHat.helpers`) implements **branch-per-chat** — each Copilot Chat conversation gets its own git worktree, and switching between chats seamlessly switches the visible branch, file explorer, and git status. This requires three non-standard integrations:

1. **Programmatic folder switching** without a confirmation dialog
2. **Branch display override** in the status bar without mutating HEAD
3. **Chat session focus events** to know when the user switches conversations
4. **Chat session history events** to observe committed turns without scraping private JSONL files

The first three are currently working via patches + proposed API. The fourth currently uses a local private-session-storage workaround. These proposals aim to land proper API support so all four work without internal storage scraping or bundle patches.
