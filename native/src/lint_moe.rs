//! `lint_moe` — a mixture of experts that reads code and reasons in pure 1-bit signal
//! space. No English words enter the reasoning: a code window becomes a hypervector, a
//! signal-space router gates it to the most relevant experts, and each expert reasons by
//! nearest-violation-signal plus the causation gate, emitting a rule INDEX. A word
//! (the rule name) appears only when a verdict is finally reported.
//!
//! Why MoE: one flat pool of every rule's signals collides across unrelated categories
//! (a perf-rule signal matching a style window) — that wrecks attribution and invents
//! false flags. Splitting the docs into experts and routing each window to a few of them
//! prunes those collisions *and* shrinks the search, so it is both more accurate and
//! faster than the flat pool.
