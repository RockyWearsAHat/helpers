//! `lint_ai` — the 1-bit XOR associative engine: the model that *is* the linter.
//!
//! No tree-sitter, no grammar, no per-rule code. Everything is a fixed-width binary
//! hypervector and the only operations are XOR (bind/compare), bit-rotate (order), and
//! majority (bundle). That makes it 1-bit, float-free, and **open-vocabulary**: any
//! token of any language maps to a code by hashing, so the model isn't built for a
//! language — it ingests whatever it's shown. Knowledge of "all the languages" is just
//! the codebook being universal.
//!
//! How it represents code:
//!   * `Hv` — a `DIM`-bit vector packed into `u64`s.
//!   * `token_hv(t)` — a token's code: a deterministic random `Hv` seeded by the token
//!     hash. Same token ⇒ same code, everywhere, in every language.
//!   * a window of tokens ⇒ one `Hv` by XOR-binding each token under a position
//!     rotation (`bind`), so order matters and the whole window is one code.
//!   * a *class* (e.g. a rule's bad pattern, or "clean") ⇒ a prototype `Hv`: the
//!     majority-bundle of all its training windows, thresholded back to 1 bit.
//!
//! How it judges: encode a window, XOR it against each prototype, count set bits
//! (`distance`). Nearest prototype wins. A window is flagged for a rule only when it is
//! closer to that rule's bad prototype than to the clean prototype by a margin — the
//! associative form of "matches the documented bad example, not the good one".
