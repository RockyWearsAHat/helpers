//! `lint_practice` — the second detector: practice / "idea" rules learned from prose, not from a
//! code pair. A principle like *"a function should do one thing"* or *"prefer shallow control flow"*
//! has no fixed subtree to match — it is a **measurable property judged against the project's own
//! norm**. This module gives the linter a small, fixed set of language-agnostic structural *senses*
//! (a function's size, how many distinct things it does, how deeply it nests) and lets a prose
//! principle ACTIVATE a sense by the words it uses. So adding a practice rule is pure documentation:
//! summarize a software-practice principle into the corpus and, if its words name a sense the linter
//! has, it begins flagging the project's outliers on that sense — no code change.
//!
//! Why outliers, not a fixed threshold: "700 lines is too long" is not universal (a generated table
//! may be fine; a 60-line orchestrator may be the worst unit in a tidy codebase). The defensible
//! signal is *relative* — a unit that does far more than how this project usually writes code. The
//! corpus says exactly this ("judged distributionally against the project's norm, not by a fixed
//! number"). We use Tukey's fence (above the third quartile by more than 1.5× the interquartile
//! range), and abstain when the project is too small to have a norm.
