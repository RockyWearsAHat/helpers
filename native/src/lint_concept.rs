//! `lint_concept` — seed semantic understanding from the docs, not a hand-built analyzer.
//!
//! Type/ownership/dataflow concepts (Copy, `const`, mutable, borrow, iterator, allocation,
//! panic, lifetime…) are exactly what the rule descriptions *explain*: "Checks for `.clone()`
//! on a `Copy` type", "this could be `const`", "holding a `RefCell` across an `await`". So the
//! model can LEARN what those concepts mean in code by reading which constructs each concept
//! co-occurs with across all the documentation — the dictionary→English trick, applied to
//! semantic concepts instead of words. No type engine: the meaning is grown from the docs.
//!
//! This is the initial idea, deliberately simple: a co-occurrence lexicon between the English
//! concepts in a rule's description and the code constructs in its example. It already lets the
//! model say what concepts a piece of code *involves* (its learned semantic profile) and what a
//! concept *looks like* in code — the seed a deeper, dataflow-aware layer can grow from.
