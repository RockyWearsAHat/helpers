//! `lint_sig` — the signature detector: the approach that won the measurements, made into a
//! usable linter. It learns from the documentation, with no per-rule or per-node-kind code.
//!
//! Each rule gets its OWN signature (so there is no bundled-expert interference — the
//! "recursive/per-rule capacity" result), grounded in either of two modalities:
//!
//!   * **Structure** — the rare AST structures (from [`crate::lint_ast::generic_features`]) that
//!     appear in the rule's bad example but not its good one and are uncommon in the language
//!     corpus. Two or more such structures ⇒ a precise, zero-false-positive signature.
//!   * **Description** — for rules whose bad and good parse identically (the distinction is a
//!     name/type/semantic, not syntax), the English description names the construct. We mine its
//!     backtick spans for identifiers that are distinctive across rules AND rare in the corpus,
//!     and require that construct present in the code — learning the construct from its
//!     dictionary entry.
//!
//! A rule fires only when its whole signature is present, so unrelated code is never flagged;
//! a rule we can ground in neither modality abstains rather than guess.
