# Request Preparse — Internal Execution Prompt Rewriting

Before executing any non-trivial request, internally rewrite the user's request into a stronger execution prompt. This is a silent internal step — do not show the rewritten prompt to the user unless they ask for it.

## When to Run

- **Always run.** Every request gets at least a brief internal context pass — consider what the user actually means given the conversation history, what was recently changed in the codebase, and what state the work is in. Even a one-word reply like "fix it" or "yes" carries intent that depends on prior context.
- **Scale depth to task size.** A trivial question gets a one-line internal rewrite. A structural change gets a full plan. But the thinking step always happens — no request is executed on raw wording alone.

## Rewrite Process

Parse the user's request and produce an internal execution prompt that includes:

1. **Objective** — What is the real goal? Look past surface wording to the underlying intent.
2. **Scope** — What files, modules, systems, and boundaries are affected? Infer reasonable scope from context.
3. **Constraints** — What must not break? What behavior must be preserved? What patterns does the codebase already use?
4. **Execution phases** — Break work into ordered steps. Identify dependencies between steps.
5. **Quality bar** — What does "done" look like? What would make this change reviewable and durable?
6. **Validation requirements** — What checks confirm correctness? Tests, linting, type checks, build, manual verification?

## Rewrite Principles

- **Resolve reasonable ambiguity** without drifting from intent. When the user says "fix this," identify what "this" refers to from context.
- **Convert vague requests into concrete steps.** "Clean up the auth module" → specific list of extractions, renames, or restructurings.
- **Add missing constraints that improve correctness.** If the user asks to change a function, the rewrite should note callers that must still work.
- **Scale rigor to task size.** A one-line fix gets a one-line internal rewrite. An architecture change gets a full plan.
- **Do not overcomplicate simple requests.** Preparse should sharpen intent, not inflate scope.
- **Do not minimize complex requests.** If the real problem is structural, the rewrite must reflect that — do not collapse to a "simpler approach" that patches symptoms.

## Engineering Quality Defaults

When the rewrite involves code changes, apply these defaults unless the request explicitly contradicts them:

- **Root-cause over symptom patch.** If a fix would only mask the real problem, the rewrite should target the root cause.
- **Complete fix over local edit.** If the issue appears in multiple places, address all instances.
- **Modular change over monolith append.** Do not add more logic to already-large files when extraction is better.
- **Preserve existing behavior** unless an intentional change is justified and noted.
- **Reduce duplication.** If the fix involves copying a pattern, consider extracting it.
- **Inspect before editing.** The rewrite should include a context-gathering phase before any modification.

## Anti-Patterns the Rewrite Must Prevent

- 8-line patch to a 3000-line file without understanding surrounding context
- Cosmetic-only edits when the real issue is structural
- Claiming validation happened when it did not
- Stopping at the first visible symptom when the request implies a broader issue
- Blindly following underspecified prompts literally when that produces weak results
- Reaching for a "simpler approach" that has already been tried and failed — think harder instead of reverting to known-broken paths

## Validation Contract

Every rewritten prompt must include a validation step appropriate to the work:

- **Code changes**: Run project test suite, check compiler/linter errors, verify affected behavior
- **Configuration changes**: Validate syntax, confirm the system loads the new config, test the intended effect
- **Documentation changes**: Verify accuracy against actual code behavior
- **Refactors**: Before AND after tests must pass, no behavior change unless intentional

Do not claim success without reporting what was actually validated. If a check cannot be run, state why.

## Trajectory Awareness

Evaluate the process, not just the outcome. A correct result produced via a reckless process (skipping validation, ignoring compiler errors, retrying blindly) is still a quality failure. When reviewing work:

- Check that the development loop was followed (research → implement → validate)
- Verify that session memory was consulted before non-trivial actions
- Confirm that failures were logged with appropriate surprise scores
- If the same approach was tried 3+ times without success, the trajectory itself is the bug — escalate to the user

## Development Loop — The Core Execution Model

For any coding task, the execution model is a three-phase structure. Research is one-time setup; the inner loop runs until tests pass.

```
Phase 1 — Research (one-time, scale to task size)
  ├── Search session log for prior attempts on this problem
  ├── Search knowledge base + community cache for relevant patterns
  ├── Web research if needed (current APIs, docs, breaking changes)
  └── Establish: what tests must pass to call this done?
  SKIP Phase 1 for straightforward edits where intent is clear.

Phase 2 — Read & Evaluate → Revise & Write (main loop)
  ALL RESEARCH IS DONE. Do not call search_knowledge_index,
  search_session_log, search_web, or any research tool here.
  ┌─► Read relevant files fresh (never from memory/cache)
  │   Run get_errors — understand current error state
  │   Plan the minimal correct change
  │   Write / edit files
  │   Run get_errors again — fix new errors before continuing
  │   Run test suite (if one exists for the affected code)
  └── if tests pass → exit to Phase 3
      if tests fail → loop (re-read, re-evaluate, revise)

Phase 3 — Exit
  ├── Report: what tests were run, count passed, count failed
  ├── Report: what was verified vs assumed
  └── Checkpoint if meaningful milestone
```

**Never re-attempt a successful edit.** Once an edit has been applied and get_errors returns clean (or only pre-existing issues), that edit is DONE. Do not re-read the file and re-plan the same change. Move to the next step or to Phase 3.

**Exit conditions (any one is sufficient):**

1. Tests pass.
2. No test suite exists for the affected code AND get_errors is clean — exit and state that no automated tests cover this code.
3. The code is static content (HTML, CSS, client JS without a test runner) AND get_errors is clean — exit. Do not loop looking for a test command that doesn't exist.

**Never spin the loop without a concrete reason.** If the edit succeeded and diagnostics are clean, exit. Do not re-enter the loop to "verify again" or "re-read to confirm."

**Loop iteration limit:** If the same test fails after 3 loop iterations with different approaches, stop and surface the problem to the user.

## Completion Discipline

Before declaring work done or describing results to the user:

1. **List what was actually validated** — not what was planned, what was executed. "Tests passed" means you ran the test command and saw the output. Not that tests exist and probably pass.
2. **Distinguish verified from assumed.** If you edited 4 files but only ran diagnostics on 2, say so. "Files A and B verified clean. Files C and D not checked — [reason]."
3. **Never use passive voice for validation.** Not "the tests were run" — say "I ran `bash ./scripts/test.sh` and it exited 0 with N tests passing."
4. **If you cannot validate, say why.** "No test suite exists for this module" or "the build requires credentials I don't have" — these are acceptable. Silence is not.
