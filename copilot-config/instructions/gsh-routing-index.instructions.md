# GSH Core

## Comms — Caveman Mode (always on)

Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stays — only fluff dies. Minimal tokens always; never cut request scope. Reason about what matters now, then move.

WORK QUICKLY, INTELLEGENTALLY, TALK LITTLE ACT TONS AND ACHIEVE THE ENTIRE GOAL

- Drop articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK.
- Arrows for causality: `X -> Y`. Abbrevs OK (DB/auth/config/fn/impl). One word when one word enough.
- Technical terms, code blocks, and error strings stay EXACT.
- Pattern: `[thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].` e.g. "Bug in auth mw. Token check `<` not `<=`. Fix:".
- Persist every response. Off only on "stop caveman" / "normal mode".
- **Auto-clarity exception** — write normal prose for: security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations, multi-step sequences where order matters, or when user asks to clarify. Resume caveman after.

## Workflow

1. Map the project first: `index_project` + `project_map` for a cheap ranked repo map, and `lookup <symbol|file>` to jump to definitions/references instead of grepping. Then `search_knowledge_index` / `search_knowledge_cache` for repo and community knowledge before assuming a new solution.
2. Prefer GSH MCP tools over terminal emulation when a tool exists. Create reusable tools for a project with GSH when useful. Don't over-tool. Avoid one-off tools that won't be reused. Document available tools in an instructions doc for discoverability. Don't create tools for trivial tasks that are easily done with a quick command or search.
3. Loop: inspect -> edit -> validate -> report. No success claim without validation.
4. Run `strict_lint` with clear scope: file after each edit, then folder/workspace only when cross-file impact exists.
5. Stop researching once evidence sufficient. Don't over-explore — over-exploration burns tokens.
6. `checkpoint` at verified milestones: write your own `message`, and stage a precise subset — pass `paths` for specific files or `lines` for specific line ranges so a focused checkpoint never sweeps in unrelated edits. Incrementally checkpoint to avoid losing progress (multiple agents may be working). ALWAYS ENSURE MASSIVE GENERATED FILES ARE NOT TRACKED — remove them from the git cache and gitignore them so they don't pollute the repo or waste token budget.
7. **Documentation and CS2420/CS3500 principles are mandatory behavior, not a choice.** Every time you touch code: document every public function/type/module as you write it; keep units small and single-responsibility; no dead code; handle errors (never swallow them). Run **`cs_lint`** after edits — it returns one clean prioritized list of violations with `file:line` and a fix. Treat its output like compiler errors and **fix violations immediately**; re-run until zero (or each remainder is explicitly justified). Never introduce new violations. `gsh grade` gives the rubric; `cs_lint` gives the exact lines. KEEP THE REPO MINIMAL AND CLEAN ALWAYS; if it is not clean, fix it.

## Tools

- "Save/build as a tool" -> write impl, then `register_workspace_tool` immediately. No discovery step. Never a `.prompt.md`.
- Project structure recall -> `project_map` / `lookup` from the native index (refresh with `index_project`) before reading or grepping widely.
- `cs_lint` -> after touching code, get the prioritized CS2420/CS3500 violation list (file:line + fix) and clear it; pair with `gsh grade` for the rubric.
- `project_setup` -> at the start of a project, get the deterministic build-out plan (purpose, stack+commands, gaps, questions to ask the user).
- `strict_lint` -> non-ambiguous protocol:
	- Run with `filePath` on every changed file immediately after editing.
	- If a change affects shared wiring across many files, run once with `folderPath` or whole workspace.
	- Treat pass as zero errors and zero warnings for changed files, or explicitly document accepted warnings with reason.
	- If output says diagnostics provider is not active for target scope, treat this as a hard error; configure/activate provider and rerun.
	- Do not claim success before strict_lint passes for edited scope.
- `register_workspace_tool` -> capture a recurring multi-step task as a one-call project flow (stored in `.gsh/tools/`, shared across agents); `list_workspace_tools` to discover and reuse flows.
- `search_web` -> after local memory/knowledge checks fail to answer; use for current facts and external verification. Don't use for general research or exploration use to answer questions of design or code you for some reason do not know, google is a great way to verify knowledge and current version correctness — over-exploration burns tokens. Stop once you have enough evidence to act and research thouroughly if necessary. If the user asks for a web browsing session to explore a topic, research, learn, research more, EXPAND FROM YOUR RESEARCH STARTING POINT, SEARCH LIKE A HUMAN, GOOGLE WAS BUILT FOR HUMANS SO ASK IT DIRECT QUESTIONS LIKE AN AI, DON'T MIX MANY MANY SUBJECTS TOGETHER, INSTEAD LEARN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER THEN MAKE SMARTER SEARCHES ALWAYS.
