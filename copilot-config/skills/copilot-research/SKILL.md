# Copilot Research

Gather real, current, verified Copilot customization knowledge that directly applies to this project.

The research must be thorough. Surface-level research produces surface-level results. The quality of everything that follows depends on how well this step understands what Copilot can do today, what has changed recently, what guidance is now outdated or deprecated, which sources should shape the normative target state, and what the correct patterns are for this specific type of project.

Thorough means breadth, depth, triangulation, and clarity. You must cover the topic from multiple source types, go past overview material into the pages, files, and transcripts that actually define behavior and design intent, and cross-check major conclusions so that one weak source cannot distort the result.

The goal is not total knowledge of the entire system. The goal is enough understanding to define the intended current best-practices setup for this workspace confidently and to remove any confusion that would block evaluation or implementation.

The point of this phase is not to produce a pile of consulted sources. The point is to define the clean target state that the evaluator and implementer should aim for.

The point is also to discover better implementations. If the current setup technically works but the evidence shows a cleaner, clearer, more maintainable, more efficient, or more accurately routed design, you are expected to surface that.

Research should clarify uncertainty. It should not leave the next phase more confused than before. If the output still feels muddy, overloaded, hard to explain, unclear about which guidance is current versus outdated, or unclear about which sources deserve the most weight, keep researching until you can state the best-practices target state clearly.

## What You Are Researching

You are not researching the project itself. The project is fine.

This phase has two research tracks. Both are required when the project has technology-specific instruction files. Run track 1 first; run track 2 in parallel once you have confirmed which technology domains the project's instruction files address.

**Track 1 — Copilot mechanics**: You are researching how Copilot customization works right now, what the correct file formats and field names are, what patterns exist for projects like this one, and what common mistakes look like. The goal is to know enough that when you look at the `.github/` folder, you can immediately tell what is correct, what is outdated, what is broken, what is missing, and what could be made cleaner or clearer even if it is not strictly broken.

**Track 2 — Domain content** (required when technology-specific instruction files are present): When the project has instruction files scoped to a specific language, framework, or technical domain, your research also establishes what _substantive_ guidance for that domain looks like. Structural validity is not enough — an instruction file that only mirrors what a linter or type checker already enforces adds no real value. Track 2 research answers: what are the judgment calls, design philosophy choices, architectural tradeoffs, testability principles, and canonical practices that distinguish informed guidance for this domain from generic defaults? Pull from the community cache's domain-knowledge entries first, then from official specifications, canonical references, and community practitioner consensus for the relevant technology. Use this baseline to evaluate whether the project's instruction file content is genuinely useful or thinly scaffolded.

## Runtime Boundaries

The context agent already read the workspace. Do not repeat that work.

- Do not search the workspace for more Copilot files during the research phase.
- Do not treat workspace files as evidence of best practice.
- Only read workspace artifacts that were explicitly handed to you for this phase, such as the context report or the persistent audit research cache.
- If a repo-owned community-cache contract or shared-cache manifest is explicitly handed to you for this phase, you may use it as a lower-authority research accelerator.
- Spend the research budget on external evidence: official docs, release notes, repository examples, transcripts, and model validation.
- If you catch yourself reading local source files or `.github/` files to answer a research question, stop and switch back to external sources.

Use the context only to understand the project type, the active workflows, the current Copilot surface area, and the user's focus. Do not let current repo wording anchor you to the current implementation if the documentation and strong examples point toward a better design.

If a versioned community cache is available, use it as pre-research context rather than as proof. It is useful for candidate principles, example discovery, anti-pattern recall, and drift detection, but it must not override fresh official or product guidance.

Use the user's focus and the inferred project intent aggressively. If the audit was launched with a focus, optimize the research toward that focus. If no focus was given, infer likely goals from the project type, source layout, and current customization intent, then research toward the workflows that most matter.

The user focus is not a tag or a footnote — it defines what you should spend most of your research effort on. Examples:

- User focus is "visual testing flow" → research how Copilot customization can support visual regression testing, screenshot comparison workflows, visual testing tools integration, and skills/agents for that workflow.
- User focus is "qt qss" → research Qt/QSS patterns in Copilot customization, Style Sheet guidance, Qt-specific skills, and real Qt projects with `.github/` files.
- No user focus → research broadly for this project type.

Your general Copilot customization research (docs, file types, frontmatter, etc.) still matters, but the user-focus-specific research must be deep and specific, not a paragraph tacked onto generic findings.

Do not smuggle in workflow preferences that the project did not ask for and the evidence does not justify. Visual testing, screenshot capture, replay tooling, autonomous debugging helpers, and other specialized flows are valid only when the user's focus, the project type, or the external evidence shows they are genuinely useful here. Do not recommend them as defaults for unrelated repositories just because they worked well somewhere else.

### File Type Purposes

One of the most important things to verify is the intended purpose of each file type. These purposes define what content belongs where. Putting content in the wrong file type causes real behavioral problems — for example, an agent file stuffed with task instructions will cause the model to do the work itself instead of loading its skill.

Research and verify the current intended purpose of each file type. Do not assume — these could change. Report what you find so the evaluator can check every file against it.

You are expected to come back with normative expectations, not just observations. Say what belongs in each file type, what does not, and what a clean setup for this project type should optimize for.

Normative does not mean hardcoded taste. Do not turn one repo's preferences, one video's style, or one clever example into a universal rule unless stronger and more current evidence supports it. Derive the recommendation from current syntax requirements, current docs, release notes, strong product guidance, and project fit.

For prompt quality, separate underlying design from surface phrasing. A strong prompt usually clarifies principles, expectations, goals, success criteria, boundaries, evidence standards, and handoff shape. A weak prompt tries to make the model "sound right", "seem correct", or imitate confidence without improving the workflow. Research the difference explicitly.

The audited workflow must work with Copilot's intended operating model, not against it. Favor examples that help Copilot understand the job, the boundaries, and the desired collaboration pattern. Treat examples that over-script internal reasoning, force fake certainty, or duplicate methodology in the wrong primitive as anti-patterns unless stronger evidence proves otherwise.

You are expected to convert complex findings into plain English. If you cannot explain the core idea simply, you have not understood it well enough yet.

You are also expected to distinguish current guidance from stale guidance. If you find older examples, older videos, older docs, or community advice that conflicts with newer official guidance or release notes, say so explicitly and treat the newer authoritative guidance as controlling unless you have strong evidence otherwise.

Do not throw away an example just because it is older, imperfect, or technically malformed. Older examples can still teach useful prompting patterns, workflow structure, or design tradeoffs. The important distinction is this: examples are usually illustrative evidence, while official docs, release notes, and strong product-team guidance are the primary normative evidence for what should be recommended now.

When an older example teaches a useful idea but uses outdated syntax, outdated field names, or deprecated workflow structure, translate the idea into the current supported form before recommending it. Never promote old syntax just because the underlying idea is still useful.

## Source Priority

1. Official VS Code and GitHub Copilot documentation and release notes — this is the most reliable source
2. Product-team guidance — Burke Holland's channel is especially useful for understanding how Copilot customization actually works in practice, not for templates but for understanding the design and intent behind features ([https://www.youtube.com/@BurkeHolland](https://www.youtube.com/@BurkeHolland))
3. Well-maintained reference repositories — Awesome Copilot ([https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot)) and Anthropic's skills repo ([https://github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills))
   3 1/2. Public repositories that compile skills/agents/prompts, such as Antigravity or ANVIL
4. Anthropic tool design guidance — the advanced tool use engineering post ([https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use)) and programmatic tool calling docs ([https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling)). These define how to design tools that AI agents use effectively: clear naming, detailed output format documentation, structured returns, on-demand discovery, context-efficient orchestration, and input examples for parameter accuracy. These principles apply directly to Copilot customization: skill descriptions are discovery surfaces (like tool search), progressive loading avoids context bloat (like defer_loading), and subagent delegation patterns mirror programmatic tool calling's code-based orchestration.
5. Public repositories with similar project types that use `.github/` customization
6. Community sources — only when backed up by something stronger

**Domain content sources** (for Track 2 — evaluating technology-specific instruction file content):

1. Community cache domain-knowledge entries for the relevant technology, if present — these are pre-researched, stable baselines that accelerate the audit
2. Official language or framework documentation and specifications
3. Canonical practitioner references widely recognized in that technology community (well-known books, published style guides, official engineering blogs)
4. Community practitioner consensus from well-maintained resources for the relevant domain

Domain content sources answer: what are the design philosophy tenets, architectural tradeoffs, testability signals, resource model constraints, and canonical judgment calls that an expert in this domain would put into an instruction file that a linter cannot express? The goal is a calibrated baseline — not a checklist of everything the domain could address, but the specific depth markers that distinguish genuine domain guidance from generic defaults.

Do not treat any single source as enough on its own. Cross-check everything.

When evidence conflicts, prefer the most current authoritative source that is still relevant to the exact feature being audited. Do not flatten old and new guidance into a compromise. Call out deprecations, renamed fields, replaced patterns, and examples that were valid once but should not drive the target state now. At the same time, preserve useful example patterns as examples when they still illuminate how people achieved better results.

Treat invalid or deprecated customization syntax the same way you would treat compile errors in source code: as real errors to eliminate, not quirks to tolerate. When two approaches achieve the same result, prefer the currently supported, documented form because it is the more durable and lower-risk choice.

Do not use Awesome Copilot, Anthropic skills, or any other meta-repository as your main source of truth for requirements. They are useful for examples, discovery, and common patterns, not for turning optional ideas into mandatory rules unless the official docs or stronger product guidance agree.

Do not use a shared community cache as your main source of truth either. The cache can improve coverage and consistency across runs, but normative recommendations still require fresh verification against stronger sources.

Do not treat product-team video evidence as optional flavor. It is one of the best sources for how the system is intended to be used in practice, how pieces fit together, and what high-quality agentic workflows actually look like. When product-team guidance and user-derived examples disagree, the product-team guidance should usually carry more weight for the normative recommendation.

Do not treat Anthropic's tool design guidance as irrelevant to Copilot customization. The principles from the advanced tool use engineering post and Claude API docs apply directly to how you design agents, skills, and tool surfaces in `.github/`. Specifically:

- **Tool discovery** — just as the Tool Search Tool uses `defer_loading` to keep only relevant tools in context, skills use progressive loading (name+description first, full SKILL.md only when invoked). Both solve the same problem: context bloat from pre-loading everything. Evaluate skill descriptions with the same rigor you would evaluate tool descriptions for discoverability.
- **Tool descriptions** — Anthropic's guidance says: provide detailed output format documentation, return structured data, use clear descriptive names. The same applies to skill descriptions, agent descriptions, and instruction content. If a skill description doesn't tell the model when to use it, when NOT to use it, and what it produces, it is under-specified.
- **Tool examples** — `input_examples` improved parameter accuracy from 72% to 90% in Anthropic's testing. The analog in Copilot customization is concrete invocation patterns in skill files and realistic usage examples in agent descriptions. Skills that show concrete expected inputs and outputs are more reliably invoked.
- **Orchestration efficiency** — programmatic tool calling reduces context pollution by processing intermediate results in code rather than the model's context. The analog is subagent delegation: each subagent runs in its own context window, keeping intermediate results from polluting the main agent's context. Design multi-step workflows with this in mind.
- **Least-privilege access** — `allowed_callers` restricts which contexts can invoke a tool. The `tools:` field in `.agent.md` serves the same purpose. Both follow the principle: give each component only the capabilities it needs.

## How to Actually Research (This Is the Critical Part)

Fetching a webpage and reading the landing page is not research. Most useful information is not on the first page you visit. You must navigate, explore, and follow links to find the actual content.

Do not stop when you have enough material to sound convincing. Stop when you have enough material to be precise and simple.

**Mandatory page scrape rule**: After every `search_web` call, each result URL that you intend to use as evidence MUST be fetched with `scrape_webpage` (or `web/fetch` as fallback) before any finding from that result is used. Snippets alone are insufficient evidence. **Hard rule: Do not use a search result as evidence unless you have read the full page.** Scanning a snippet and moving on is guessing with extra steps.

Prefer the built-in `fetch` tool for official documentation pages and the built-in `githubRepo` tool for reading public repository files. Use terminal commands as a fallback when those tools cannot retrieve a specific artifact. Do not claim the research was blocked just because one tool path failed if another documented path is still available. If one tactic stalls, change tactics and keep going.

Your first meaningful actions in this phase should usually be external: fetch the official docs or inspect public repository examples. Do not begin by searching the workspace.

### Official Documentation

The official docs are spread across multiple pages. Do not stop at the landing page. Typical structure:

1. Start at the main customization page (e.g. `https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot`)
2. That page will have links to subpages about specific topics — instruction files, custom agents, prompt files, skills, etc. **Follow those links and read those pages.**
3. For VS Code docs, check `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization` and its subpages.
4. Check release notes by searching for "copilot" in recent VS Code changelogs: `https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/`

Freshness requirements:

1. Use release notes and current docs to validate that guidance is still current before promoting it to target-state guidance.
2. If you rely on an older repo example or older video because it explains something especially well, verify that the pattern still matches current docs or recent product guidance before treating it as normative. It can still be cited as an example even when it is not current enough to define the recommendation.
3. If you cannot verify freshness for an important normative claim, mark it as uncertain rather than silently treating it as current best practice.

If a page mentions a feature but doesn't explain the details, look for a "learn more" link or search the docs site for that feature name. Do not assume the first page you land on has everything.

If a page gives a summary table, look for the page that defines the behavior behind the table. If a page gives an example, look for the guide or reference that explains why the example is structured that way.

### Repositories

Fetching a repository's landing page gives you the README. The README rarely contains the actual customization files. To see how a repository sets up Copilot:

- First try the built-in `githubRepo` tool to inspect the repository and read the actual `.github/` files.
- If the built-in repo tool cannot access the needed file, fall back to `gh api` in the terminal.

```bash
# List the .github folder structure of a repo
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/git/trees/main?recursive=1 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r '.tree[].path' | grep '^\.github/'

# Read a specific file from a repo
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/.github/copilot-instructions.md 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r '.content' | base64 -d

# Read an instruction file
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/.github/instructions/FILENAME 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r '.content' | base64 -d

# Read an agent file
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/.github/agents/FILENAME 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r '.content' | base64 -d
```

When you find a relevant repository:

1. List its `.github/` folder to see what files exist
2. Read the actual files that are relevant — instruction files, agent files, prompt files, skill files
3. Read at least one additional project artifact that explains why their Copilot setup fits the project: build config, CI workflow, test setup, contributing guide, or a representative code area tied to the same workflow
4. Note what patterns they use: frontmatter fields, `applyTo` patterns, file naming, folder structure, routing, and how the customization matches actual project workflows
5. Do this for at least 3 repositories to see what is common vs unusual

Do not overweight examples just because there are many of them. Use them to learn how people structured prompts, agents, skills, and workflows in practice. Use docs, release notes, and strong product-team guidance to decide which of those patterns should actually shape the recommendation now.

Prefer real projects over definition repositories. A strong project example has actual source code, build/test workflows, and Copilot files that appear tailored to that reality.

Do not collect repositories mechanically. Pick repositories that actually teach you something different, then extract the specific pattern they prove.

### Skills and Related Workflow Patterns

Skill discovery matters. Look for many real `SKILL.md` files and other task-oriented Copilot assets that map to the audited workspace's workflows.

When researching skills:

1. Prefer skills that are closely related to the audited workspace's actual work: build, test, UI, debugging, deployment, security, domain workflows, or the user-provided focus.
2. Read the actual `SKILL.md` files, not just repo listings.
3. Extract useful skill patterns: when the skill is invoked, how narrowly it is scoped, what sources it uses, how it shapes outputs, and why it is effective.
4. Reject irrelevant skill examples even if they are popular.

The goal is not to recommend random skills. The goal is to understand what kinds of skills or workflow-specific guidance would actually improve this workspace.

### Awesome Copilot and Curated Lists

These repositories are curated example libraries, not primary normative documentation. Their value is in both the links they contain and the working customization files they publish.

```bash
# Get the README of awesome-copilot, which contains curated links
gh api repos/github/awesome-copilot/contents/README.md 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r '.content' | base64 -d

# Then follow the links that are relevant to customization
```

Read the README to find links. Then follow the links that relate to customization, agents, instructions, or workspace setup. The list itself is not the research — it's the starting point.

For audits of Copilot customization quality, you must also inspect actual working examples from `github/awesome-copilot` itself. Read real prompt, instruction, agent, or skill files from that repository and extract why they work. Do not just say they look good. Explain what principle each example demonstrates: how it defines goals, expectations, boundaries, collaboration flow, or output shape.

Do not copy Awesome Copilot wording into the target state by default. Translate useful ideas into this project's needs and the current supported Copilot workflow. If an example is strong mainly because it is clear about principles and intent, keep the principle, not the prose.

Do not stop with a curated-list README. If your report cites curated guidance, it should mostly be to support or contrast conclusions already grounded in official docs and real project repositories.

### Burke Holland Videos

The community cache includes pre-cleaned plaintext transcripts from key Burke Holland / VS Code YouTube videos. Use these first before downloading new transcripts.

#### Using cached transcripts (preferred)

1. Read `community-cache/snapshots/<current>/video-transcripts.json` to see available transcripts with topics and key insights.
2. Read the relevant `.txt` files from `community-cache/snapshots/<current>/transcripts/` — these are clean flowing plaintext, not raw VTT.
3. Extract concrete workflow principles, not just factual snippets.
4. Note where transcript guidance reinforces, clarifies, or tensions with the official docs.

Available cached transcripts:

- `fabAI1OKKww-agent-skills-guide.txt` — Skills: structure, progressive loading, scripts, templates, when to use skills vs instructions vs agents vs prompts
- `5NxGqnTazR8-ultimate-agent-mode-tutorial.txt` — Agent mode: vision, MCP, custom agents, tool restrictions, model selection
- `s7Qzq0ejhjg-ask-edit-agent-overview.txt` — Chat modes: Ask vs Edit vs Agent, system prompt structure, instructions injection
- `0XoXNG65rfg-level-up-productivity.txt` — Productivity workflows: prompt files, instructions, custom agents, combining them

#### Downloading new transcripts (when cached ones don't cover the topic)

If transcript tooling is unavailable locally, report that specific limitation and continue with the rest of the research instead of downgrading the entire pass to shallow research.

```bash
# Search for recent videos
yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print "%(id)s %(title)s %(upload_date)s %(channel)s" \
  "ytsearch10:Burke Holland copilot customization" 2>/dev/null

# Download transcript for a relevant video
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --write-subs --sub-lang en --sub-format vtt --skip-download \
  -o "/tmp/yt-transcript-%(id)s" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" 2>/dev/null

# Clean the raw VTT into readable plaintext
./scripts/community-cache-clean-transcript.sh /tmp/yt-transcript-VIDEO_ID.en.vtt /tmp/VIDEO_ID-clean.txt

# Read the cleaned transcript (NOT the raw .vtt)
cat /tmp/VIDEO_ID-clean.txt
```

IMPORTANT: Always run raw VTT files through `community-cache-clean-transcript.sh` before reading. Raw VTT contains inline timing tags, duplicate lines, and alignment metadata that wastes context tokens and degrades comprehension.

Pick videos by title relevance and recency. Read the transcripts for specific claims about how Copilot customization works, what fields do what, what changed, and what mistakes to avoid.

This is not optional in a normal pass. You are expected to use product-team transcript evidence to understand practical workflow design, not just syntax rules.

Transcript selection rules:

1. Prefer Burke Holland videos first when they are relevant to Copilot customization, agents, prompt files, skills, workflow design, or end-to-end agentic development.
2. Prefer recent videos, but allow slightly older ones if they are clearly more relevant to the feature or workflow under review and you verify that their guidance still matches current docs or release notes for normative use.
3. Pick transcripts that help answer how the system is intended to be composed and used efficiently, not just what fields exist.
4. If the audit has a user focus, prioritize transcripts that illuminate that workflow.

Transcript usage rules:

1. Extract concrete workflow principles, not just factual snippets.
2. Note where transcript guidance reinforces, clarifies, or tensions with the official docs.
3. Use transcript insights to improve the `Target-state blueprint`, especially around workflow structure, role separation, and practical efficiency.
4. If the transcript shows a more effective pattern than the current repo setup, surface that as an improvement opportunity.

If no relevant transcript can be retrieved, document the exact commands attempted, the exact failure, and why the remaining research is still usable. A transcript blocker should be rare, specific, and visible.

### Versioned Community Cache

If the audit system provides a versioned shared community cache, consume it with these rules:

1. Pulling the shared cache is the default behavior when the manifest or contract is available.
2. Start by reading `community-cache/manifest.json` to find the recommended snapshot.
3. Read the snapshot's `search-index.json` first — this is the fast-path to find relevant cached knowledge by topic, applicability, or kind.
4. Use the search index to look up entries relevant to the current audit's focus areas. For example, if auditing agent design, look up `topicIndex.agents` and `applicabilityIndex.agent-design` to find all relevant principle, practice, anti-pattern, and workflow-pattern IDs.
5. Read the specific pack files (prompting-principles.json, anti-patterns.json, etc.) to get full entries with evidenceRefs and real URLs.
6. Check `deprecations.json` for known deprecated fields or features that may affect the audit target.
7. Check `frontmatter-reference.json` for current correct field names, file locations, and format specifications.
8. Check `hooks-reference.json` for lifecycle event details if hooks are in scope.
9. Check `community-resources.json` for community repos, shared skills, and official doc URLs relevant to the audit.
10. Still do the audit's own live research; the shared cache is only bootstrap context and comparison material.
11. Record the snapshot or manifest version you used.
12. Revalidate any normative claim you inherit from the cache against stronger live evidence before recommending it.
13. Prefer append-only snapshot history and explicit changelogs so regressions can be tracked and rolled back.
14. If the cache is unreachable, stale, or malformed, continue the research pass and report the issue instead of failing the audit.
15. If community participation is enabled for the client, conclusion packets may be auto-submitted after the audit completes. Do not confuse that with replacing live research or with publishing raw mid-research notes.
16. Any community-cache output must be reduced to generalized Copilot best practices and general application advice only. Do not publish repository-specific context, workspace-specific advice, local paths, or private project descriptions.

#### Cache Consumption Quick-Path

For efficient cache usage during research:

```
1. Read manifest.json → get recommendedSnapshot
2. Read snapshots/<id>/search-index.json → find relevant IDs by topic/applicability
3. Read specific pack files for those IDs → get full entries with evidence URLs
4. Cross-reference against deprecations.json → avoid recommending deprecated patterns
5. Use community-resources.json → find official doc URLs and community repos to verify against
```

When the system is configured to improve over time, preserve these distinctions:

- `auto-pull` is normal and low-friction
- `live research` still happens on every audit
- `auto-submit conclusions` happens only for opted-in clients (can submit multiple per audit)
- `community cache content` must stay general and privacy-safe
- `snapshot rebuild` happens automatically when promoted candidates are available

**Blocking gate — mixed evidence before final conclusions**: Before finalizing recommendations, answer these three questions explicitly:

1. Did I run live web browsing and scrape at least one official source URL relevant to this audit?
2. If the community cache was reachable, did I load `community-cache/manifest.json`, `search-index.json`, and at least one relevant pack file?
3. Did I cross-check at least one normative claim using both live web evidence and cache evidence?

If the answer to any reachable requirement is "no", complete it before finishing. If a source is unreachable, log the exact failure and continue with available evidence.

## Mandatory Knowledge Note Write

At the end of the research phase, before returning the report, write all findings that are broadly reusable (not specific to the current workspace) to a dated knowledge note. Use `mcp_helpers_write_knowledge_note` to create a new note, or `mcp_helpers_update_knowledge_note` if a relevant note for the same topic already exists. When the note is privacy-safe and meant for the shared knowledge base, pass `publish: true` so the note is indexed locally and automatically submitted when knowledge sharing is enabled.

Title format: `copilot-research-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use today's date).

What belongs in the note:

- Verified current field names, valid values, and recent deprecations confirmed by official sources
- Patterns from real repository examples that generalize across projects
- Sourced normative claims worth preserving to avoid re-researching in future audits

What does not belong:

- Workspace-specific paths, filenames, or project-specific recommendations
- Unverified assumptions

**This step is required and not optional.** A research pass that produces no persisted knowledge note is incomplete by default. If `mcp_helpers_write_knowledge_note` is unavailable, report that failure explicitly and continue.

## Thoroughness Rules

Your research is only thorough if all of the following are true:

1. **Breadth**: You used multiple source types with meaningful coverage.
2. **Depth**: You went past overview pages and READMEs into the pages, files, and transcripts that actually define how things work.
3. **Triangulation**: Major conclusions are checked across at least two source types whenever possible.
4. **Precision**: You distinguish required, recommended, optional, illustrative, deprecated, stale, environment-specific, and unverified claims.
5. **Actionability**: The result tells the evaluator and implementer what correct or better looks like without forcing them back into research mode.
6. **Clarity**: You can explain the key parts of the relevant system and workflow in plain English without hiding behind jargon, vague wording, or source dumping.
7. **Uncertainty Removal**: Blocker-level confusion is resolved, not merely restated. Any remaining uncertainty must be narrow, explicit, and non-blocking to the current best-practices target state or the research is incomplete.
8. **Freshness**: The report makes clear why the recommended guidance is current, and it explicitly distinguishes between examples that are still useful to learn from and patterns that should no longer drive the recommendation.
9. **Resilience**: When one source, repo, page, or tool path fails, you keep pursuing other viable paths before reporting a blocker.

If any of these are missing, keep researching.

## Research Loop

Use this loop until the output is ready:

1. Gather an initial set of official docs and strong examples.
2. Extract tentative conclusions.
3. Stress-test those conclusions against release notes, repository files, transcripts, skills, and conflicting evidence.
4. Fill the gaps where the conclusion is still vague, weak, source-thin, potentially outdated, or overly dependent on one type of source.
5. Only then turn the conclusion into target-state guidance.

Do not jump directly from first-pass reading to final recommendations.

### GitHub Code Search

Use this to find real-world examples of specific patterns:

```bash
# Find repos using .agent.md files
gh search code "filename:.agent.md" --sort=indexed --limit=15

# Find repos using prompt files
gh search code "filename:.prompt.md path:.github/prompts" --sort=indexed --limit=15

# Find repos using skill files
gh search code "filename:SKILL.md path:.github/skills" --sort=indexed --limit=15

# Find repos using specific frontmatter fields
gh search code "applyTo" --filename=.instructions.md --sort=indexed --limit=10

# Find how people use copilot-instructions.md
gh search code "filename:copilot-instructions.md path:.github" --sort=indexed --limit=10
```

When a search returns results, pick 2-3 promising repos and actually read their `.github/` files (see the repository section above for how).

### Model Validation

```bash
gh api https://api.githubcopilot.com/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gh auth token)" \
  -H "Copilot-Integration-Id: vscode-chat" 2>/dev/null
```

### When You Hit a Dead End

If a page has no useful information:

- Check if the page links to subpages that have the actual content
- Search the same site for more specific terms
- Try a different source from the priority list
- If a repository README is unhelpful, check its `.github/` folder directly
- If one tool path fails, switch tools before concluding the evidence is unavailable
- If one repo example is noisy or malformed, mine additional examples and compare common threads instead of discarding the line of inquiry

Do not report "I checked the docs" if you only read one page and it was a landing page. Go deeper.

## What You Must Cover

Every research pass must address all of these. If you skip one, say which and why.

- Current file formats and frontmatter fields for instruction files, agent files, prompt files, and skill files
- Valid folder structure under `.github/` (what goes where)
- Current valid tool names for frontmatter `tools:` field
- Current valid model IDs (verified with the API, not assumed)
- Recent VS Code release notes for Copilot-related changes
- Recent deprecations or breaking changes (field names that changed, features that were removed)
- How 3+ real repositories structure their `.github/` Copilot files (read the actual files, not just the README)
- How those same repositories connect their customization to real project workflows beyond `.github/`
- How `github/awesome-copilot` demonstrates strong prompts, instructions, agents, or skills at the file level, and what principles those examples teach
- If a shared community cache exists, what snapshot or manifest was used, what it contributed, and what had to be revalidated or rejected
- At least 1 recent product-team video transcript for practical insights, and preferably 2 when the workflow is broad or architecture-heavy
- Known common mistakes and what the correct version looks like
- Concrete improvement opportunities or likely bugs in the audited setup, even when the current setup is not outright broken
- If the project has technology-specific instruction files: for each such file, assess whether the content addresses substantive domain concerns — design philosophy, architectural tradeoffs, testability as a design signal, performance or resource model constraints, and judgment calls that the toolchain cannot enforce. A file that only restates linter-level defaults is a content failure even if it is structurally valid. Report each file's content quality tier: broken, thin, adequate, or excellent.

Minimum evidence bar:

- At least 10 concrete external references total
- At least 4 official references across docs and release notes
- At least 3 real project repositories explored at the file level
- At least 2 concrete file-level examples from `github/awesome-copilot`, with the principle learned from each example spelled out
- At least 1 transcript or equivalent product-team primary source
- At least 3 major conclusions supported by more than one source type
- At least 3 concrete patterns learned from real external skills, agents, prompts, or instruction files that are relevant to this workspace

If transcript tooling works and relevant Burke Holland videos exist, omitting transcript evidence is a research failure.

If you do not meet this bar, the research is incomplete.

## Output

Return findings in a structured format covering:

- `Status`: complete / incomplete
- `Coverage checklist`: one line per mandatory topic with `verified`, `blocked`, or `missing`
- `Evidence ledger`: the concrete sources that support each major conclusion
- `Reference matrix`: numbered references with exact URLs and what each reference establishes
- `Target-state blueprint`: the clean intended current workflow and file design for this project type and user focus
- `Freshness notes`: what evidence is most current, what changed recently, which older patterns are still useful as examples, and which ones should not drive the current recommendation
- `Community cache status`: whether a shared cache was consulted, which version or snapshot was used, how much it helped, and which cached items were accepted, revalidated, downgraded, or rejected
- `Source weighting`: which sources are authoritative for normative claims, which are illustrative, and how conflicts were resolved
- `Implementation cues`: concrete statements the evaluator can translate into per-file keep/fix/merge/move/delete decisions
- `Improvement opportunities`: specific ways the audited setup could be better even if parts of it are technically valid
- `Domain content analysis`: For every technology-specific instruction file, state whether the content addresses substance beyond syntax: design philosophy, architectural tradeoffs, performance or resource model constraints, testability signals, and canonical judgment calls for the domain. Classify each file's content tier (broken / thin / adequate / excellent). For thin or missing content, produce a concise enrichment brief specifying which domain principles are undercovered and what concrete questions the file should help the AI answer. Skip this field only when no technology-specific instruction files are present.
- `Likely bugs or anti-patterns`: concrete failure risks, misleading guidance, routing problems, over-broad scope, duplication, or dead/inert files to look for
- `Example-derived prompting principles`: what the best external examples teach about goals, expectations, boundaries, and collaboration with Copilot, plus what should not be copied literally
- `Transcript takeaways`: concrete workflow and system-design lessons learned from product-team videos, plus how they change or sharpen the target state
- `Triangulated conclusions`: major conclusions with the source types that support them
- `Related skill patterns`: concrete skill ideas or structures discovered in external repositories that map to this workspace's workflows
- `Plain-English explanation`: a simple explanation of how the relevant part of the system works and how the pieces fit together
- `Confusion ledger`: remaining uncertainties, why they remain, whether they block action, and what would resolve them

- What the docs currently say (summarized, not copied)
- Valid model IDs (verified, not assumed)
- Relevant video or post evidence with dates
- Patterns from similar repositories
- Confirmed mistakes and pitfalls to watch for
- What has changed recently that affects customization
- Open questions where you could not find a clear answer
- Specific recommendations for this project type

The `Target-state blueprint` must be the most actionable part of the report. It should say, in plain language, what the ideal `.github/` setup should look like for this project and what qualities it should prioritize: clarity, brevity, routing accuracy, workflow fit, maintainability, and any focus-specific needs the user provided.

The blueprint must stay proportional to the project. Do not bloat a simple repository with heavyweight agent flows or specialized tooling unless the evidence shows a clear payoff for this specific project.

The `Implementation cues` must be concrete enough that the evaluator can produce an implementation-ready plan without having to go back out to the web.

The `Example-derived prompting principles` section must explain why a prompt is effective in Copilot terms. Prefer principles such as clear goals, explicit success criteria, truthful boundaries, delegated methodology, and evidence-backed expectations. Explicitly call out anti-patterns such as appearance-driven prompting, fake certainty, or instructions that fight Copilot's primitive model.

The `Reference matrix` should be dense and specific. Prefer many precise references over a few broad overview pages.

The `Community cache status` section must not blur trust boundaries. Make clear that the cache accelerated discovery or preserved prior lessons, but also make clear which items were revalidated live and which ones were discarded or downgraded.

The `Transcript takeaways` must not be filler. They should capture what the product-team source teaches about composing agents, prompts, instructions, skills, tool use, iteration flow, or other practical workflow patterns that the docs alone do not make vivid.

The `Related skill patterns` section must focus on actual useful skill designs, especially skills that map closely to the audited workspace's build, test, UI, debugging, security, deployment, or domain workflows. Do not pad this with irrelevant skill examples.

The `Plain-English explanation` must be simple enough that a non-expert could follow it. No jargon unless you define it immediately. If the explanation still sounds complicated, keep researching.

The `Confusion ledger` should usually be short. A long confusion ledger means the research is not ready. If a confusion item would make evaluation or implementation guess about the intended current best-practices target state, the overall status must be `incomplete`.

If the models API check fails, report the exact failure and fall back to current official Copilot model documentation. Do not silently skip model validation.

If any mandatory topic is still `missing` rather than `verified` or `blocked`, the overall status must be `incomplete` and you must say the research is not ready for evaluation.

For every major conclusion, cite the evidence source in plain text inside the report body, such as the doc page title and URL, repository name and file path, release notes month, or video title and date. If a conclusion has no external evidence, label it unverified instead of presenting it as established.

Be honest about what you verified and what you could not. Never present unverified information as confirmed.

Keep the report compact. The goal is a dense evidence-backed handoff with a clear target state, not a long narrative.

Compact does not mean shallow. If the report would still look plausible after deleting most of the URLs, repo paths, specific references, triangulated conclusions, or plain-English explanation, it is too weak.

## Before You Finish: Check Your Own Results

Activity is not results. Fetching 10 pages and running 4 searches means nothing if you did not learn anything from them.

Research is done when you can answer YES to all of the following. If you cannot, you are not done.

### 1. Can you describe the ideal `.github/` setup for this project?

Not in vague terms. You should be able to say exactly:

- What files should exist (instruction files, agent files, prompt files, skills)
- What each file's frontmatter should look like (which fields, which values)
- What each file's content should cover for this specific project
- What should NOT exist (unnecessary files, redundant content)
- If you implement this right now, for every single line of the file, are you absolutely certain there will be no syntax errors with the most recent version of Copilot?

If you cannot do this, you do not understand the target state well enough.

### 2. Do you have evidence from real repositories?

You should have read the actual `.github/` files (not just READMEs) from at least 3 repositories that use Copilot customization [NOT DEFINITION REPOSITORIES, BUT PROJECTS]. You should know:

- What patterns they use that have helped them reach this point, what is the current point and state? Value repositories with higher stars while avoiding purely instruction repositories as this will give us the most popular and helpful projects that have actually used copilot to help them achieve their current state.
- What they do differently from this project
- What of their ideas and uses would improve this project's setup

If you only read landing pages and search results, or READMEs, you have not seen how anyone actually does this.

You should also have read real files from `github/awesome-copilot` that illustrate strong prompt, instruction, agent, or skill design. You should be able to explain what those examples teach about principles, expectations, and collaboration with Copilot, and which parts would be wrong to copy mechanically.

### 3. Do you know what has changed recently?

Copilot customization changes frequently. You should be able to name:

- Specific features or fields that were added, changed, or deprecated recently
- Whether anything in the current `.github/` setup uses outdated syntax or patterns

If you cannot name a single recent change, you did not check.

### 4. Could you rewrite any file in `.github/` from scratch right now?

This is the real test. If someone deleted every Copilot file in `.github/` and asked you to rebuild them from scratch for this project, could you do it correctly based on what you learned? Could you write valid frontmatter, accurate content, and proper file structure without guessing?

If the answer is no, your research is not done. Go learn what you are missing.

### 5. Are your findings specific or generic?

Read through your report. If you replaced this project's name with any other project and the report would still make sense, it is too generic. Your findings should be specific to this project's type, stack, and workflows.

### 6. Did you reach real understanding, not just source collection?

You should be able to explain not only what the docs say, but why strong examples are structured the way they are and how those patterns should or should not transfer to this workspace.

If your explanation of "why this prompt is good" is mostly about tone, polish, or how convincing it sounds, you are not done. Good prompting is about guiding behavior with clear principles, expectations, goals, boundaries, and workflow fit.

If you cannot do that, you are still at source collection, not research.

### 7. Could you explain the relevant system simply to a beginner?

If you cannot explain the relevant component, workflow, or structure in clear, simple English without sounding confused yourself, you are not done. Research is supposed to remove confusion that blocks defining the best-practices system for this workspace.

If blocker-level confusion remains, return `incomplete`.
